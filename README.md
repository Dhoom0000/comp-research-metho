# Deep Learning in Cancer: Advancing Precision Medicine

Final project report for the *Computing Research Methodologies* module (Bachelor’s degree).

Author: Dhrumil Shah

## Overview

This project explores the application of deep learning techniques in cancer diagnosis and precision medicine. It investigates how neural networks and multi-omics data can improve early detection, prognosis prediction, and personalized treatment planning.

The report combines a structured literature review with a defined research methodology to evaluate the role of deep learning in medical imaging, genomics, and clinical decision-making. It also examines the social, legal, and ethical implications of integrating AI systems into healthcare.

A presentation (PowerPoint) was prepared alongside this report to summarise the research, findings, and proposed framework.

## Focus Areas

The study reviews foundational concepts in machine learning and deep learning, followed by analysis of their application in cancer prognosis, diagnostics, mammography, histology image classification, and large-scale AI initiatives such as Google’s deep learning systems for pathology.

It outlines a proposed research framework covering data collection, model development, validation, and implementation considerations within clinical environments.

## Key Themes

The project highlights the potential of deep learning to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify predictive biomarkers, and streamline clinical workflows. It also addresses limitations such as model interpretability, regulatory compliance, data privacy, bias, and integration challenges.

Estimated large-scale implementation considerations include budget, timeline, and interdisciplinary collaboration across healthcare and technical domains.
